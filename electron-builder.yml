  # - Code signing:
  #    - Generate a “Developer ID Application” certificate (this can only be done by the team’s account holder; see https://developer.apple.com/help/account/create-certificates/create-developer-id-certificates).
  #    - For the certificate to be usable by other team members, the account holder must generate (and then share) a `.p12` file and its corresponding password:
  #       - Double click on the `.cer` file (this will add the certificate to the `My Certificates` section of the `login` keychain).
  #       - Export the certificate (by right clicking on it) and give it a password.
  # - Notarisation:
  #    - APPLE_ID: the team member’s email address used to login to https://account.apple.com/.
  #    - APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD: a password the team member generated using the App-Specific Passwords tool at https://account.apple.com/account/manage.
  #    - APPLE_TEAM_ID: an id that can be found in the top right corner of https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list.
