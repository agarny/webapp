// Our CellDL Editor views get their CellDL Editor from a pool of CellDL Editors.
// Note #1: CellDL Editor never stops listening to some events on the window and the document, i.e. it never really gets
//          destroyed. So, rather than having a CellDL Editor per CellDL Editor view, which would mean leaking a CellDL
//          Editor every time a CellDL Editor view gets unmounted (e.g., when closing a CellDL file), a CellDL Editor
//          view acquires a CellDL Editor from our pool when it gets mounted and releases it when it gets unmounted. We
//          then close its diagram (which also clears its undo history), so that it can be reused. Our pool only creates
//          a CellDL Editor when it has no other spare one (see acquire()), so it never has more CellDL Editors than the
//          maximum number of CellDL Editor views that have been mounted at the same time, plus one.
// Note #2: CellDL Editor listens to keyboard events on the window and lets only one of its instances handle them, i.e.
//          the instance in which a pointer was last pressed or, by default, the first instance to have been mounted.
//          This means that pressing Backspace in one file tab could, for instance, delete the selected object(s) in
//          another (hidden) file tab. So, whenever the CellDL Editor view that is visible changes, we simulate a
//          pointer press in its CellDL Editor, so that it is the one that handles keyboard events. When no CellDL
//          Editor view is visible, we do the same with a spare CellDL Editor, which has nothing to edit.
