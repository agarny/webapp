// CellDL Editor is shared by all our CellDL Editor views, including those of different OpenCOR instances.
// Note: CellDL Editor listens to keyboard and pointer events on the window and the document, never stops listening to
//       them, and relies on some global state (e.g., its undo/redo history). This means that if we had one CellDL
//       Editor per CellDL Editor view, then pressing Backspace in one file tab could, for instance, delete the selected
//       object(s) in another (hidden) file tab. So, instead, we have only one CellDL Editor (see
//       CellDLEditorHostComponent.vue), which we move to the CellDL Editor view that is visible, and in which we open
//       the corresponding diagram. When no CellDL Editor view is visible, we close the diagram, so that CellDL Editor
//       cannot modify anything.
