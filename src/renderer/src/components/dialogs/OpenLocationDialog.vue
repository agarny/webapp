const checked = vue.ref<boolean>(false);

// The URL to open, if valid, i.e. the given URL without any leading/trailing whitespace, with a lowercase scheme (e.g.,
// "Https://" becomes "https://", as some mobile keyboards capitalise the first letter of what is typed), and with an
// https:// scheme if it has no scheme (e.g., "example.com/model.omex" becomes "https://example.com/model.omex"), and
// with the dot segments of its path, if any, resolved (see Note #6).
// Note #1: a scheme is followed by "//", so that, for instance, "localhost:8080/model.omex" is not considered as having
//          a "localhost" scheme.
// Note #2: a URL without a scheme must have a host that looks like one (i.e. a domain name, an IP address, or
//          localhost), so that, for instance, some random text is not considered as a valid URL. A domain name or an
//          IPv4 address is a host (as typed, i.e. before it gets normalised by the URL parser) with at least two
//          dot-separated labels, none of which is empty (with an optional trailing dot), so that, for instance, a
//          relative path (e.g., "./model.omex", which host would be ".") or a number (e.g., "42") is not considered as
//          a valid URL. (A relative path which first segment looks like a domain name (e.g., "model.omex") is still
//          considered as a valid URL (i.e. "https://model.omex"), hence we let people know which URL will be opened.)
//          An IPv4 address must also be typed as the URL parser would normalise it (i.e. as four decimal numbers,
//          without leading zeros and without a trailing dot), so that, for instance, a number with dot-separated parts
//          (e.g., "3.14", which the URL parser would normalise to "3.0.0.14") or an address with leading zeros (e.g.,
//          "192.168.010.001", which the URL parser would normalise to "192.168.8.1" since "010" is an octal number) is
//          not considered as a valid URL. A URL with a scheme can have any host (e.g., an intranet host, such as
//          "http://modelserver/model.omex").
// Note #3: a data URL is also valid if it is a Base64-encoded COMBINE archive (i.e. "data:application/zip;base64,...")
//          or zipped CellML file (i.e. "data:application/x.vnd.zip-cellml+zip;base64,..."), since it can then be opened
//          like any other file (see OpenCOR.openFile() and locCommon.zipDataFromDataUrl()). It is used as is, apart
//          from its scheme, media type, and ";base64" which are lowercased (since locCommon.zipDataFromDataUrl()
//          expects them to be), so, unlike for other URLs, we don't let people know which URL will be opened since it
//          would be (nearly) the same and it can be very long.
// Note #4: a URL without a scheme must also have no user name and no password, so that, for instance, an email address
//          (e.g., "user@example.com") or a mailto link (e.g., "mailto:user@example.com", which has no "//" after its
//          scheme) is not considered as a valid URL, i.e. as "https://user@example.com" or as
//          "https://mailto:user@example.com" (where "mailto" would be a user name and "user" a password). A URL with a
//          scheme can have a user name and a password (e.g., "https://user@example.com/model.omex").
// Note #5: in OpenCOR (i.e. not in OpenCOR's Web app), a local file can also be opened, be it using a "file" URL with
//          no host or a "localhost" host (e.g., "file:///some/path/model.omex") or an absolute file path (e.g.,
//          "/some/path/model.omex" or, on Windows, "C:\some\path\model.omex" or "\\server\share\model.omex"), since it
//          can then be opened like any other file (see OpenCOR.openFile()). It is used as is, apart from the scheme of
//          a "file" URL which is lowercased, and it is not decoded (see emitOpenLocation()). A "file" URL with another
//          host (e.g., "file://server/share/model.omex") is not considered as valid since libOpenCOR would consider it
//          as a remote file, which it would then retrieve synchronously (i.e. freezing our UI). A relative file path is
//          not considered as valid either since it would be relative to the working directory of OpenCOR, which people
//          cannot know. Neither is a "file" URL or a file path that doesn't end with a file name (e.g., "file:/",
//          "file:///some/path/", "/", "/some/path/..", or "C:\"), since it cannot refer to a file. Note that the query
//          and fragment of a "file" URL are ignored by libOpenCOR (e.g., "file:///some/path/model.omex?a=b#c" refers to
//          "/some/path/model.omex"), hence we only check its path.
// Note #6: the path of a Web address may contain dot segments (e.g., "https://example.com/some/path/../model.omex"),
//          which we resolve (e.g., "https://example.com/some/model.omex"), so that people know which URL will really be
//          opened, and so that the name of the file that gets opened is not "." or ".." (e.g., for
//          "https://example.com/some/path/.."). A Web address need not end with a file name (e.g.,
//          "https://example.com/some/path/download"), so a path that resolves to a "directory" (e.g.,
//          "https://example.com/some/") is still valid. Only the path of the URL is changed (using the path, as
//          percent-encoded by the URL parser), i.e. the rest of the URL is used as typed (e.g., its host is not
//          lowercased or converted to Punycode).

// Note #1: once our URL is valid (or empty), it is no longer considered as checked, so that people are not told off
