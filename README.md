# OpenCOR

[OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/) is a frontend to [libOpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/libopencor/), a library that can be used to organise, edit, simulate, and analyse [CellML](https://cellml.org/) files.

There are two versions of OpenCOR:

1. **OpenCOR:** a desktop application that can be run on [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS); and
2. **OpenCOR's Web app:** a [Web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) that can be run using a Web browser.

The main difference between the two versions is that models in OpenCOR are, by default, compiled while they can only be interpreted in OpenCOR's Web app.

## Prerequisites
